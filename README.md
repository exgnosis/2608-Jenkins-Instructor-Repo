# Jenkins Instructor Repo

Contains a directory of slides and a directory of pdf

- The labs will be pushed up to a different directory by Feb 9
- The VM image will be ready for you to explore on Feb 9

### Notes

- When I do these sorts of courses, I tend to have a copy of Jenkins running on the VM or my local machine and go through a tour of the UI for those that are not familiar with it.
- I also tend to do little things like install a plugin, run a job or do other tasks just so that students can see what I am talking about. I'm sure you do something similar.
- I also tend to jump to the official Jenkins.io documentation a lot to do deep dives into some points where students want more detail
- There may be more material than you can cover in two days, depends on the class of course. Pick and choose what you want.

### Labs

- For the labs, I walk through the first one step by step since as a demo first. It seems to help students get more confidence in the labs.
- The first two labs have a lot of screenshots to provide visual feedback to students. 
- The labs have been tested in the VM. I did find some odd things that broke some of the labs since I really don't use Windows at all and most of my labs were originally tested under Linux.
- I have made a number of alterations to the labs to ensure they work on the VM
- There may be more labs than you have tme for so pick what you need and can fit into class.
- I have deliberately not make the labs complex so they can be done in a reasonable period of time

## GOOD LUCK !!
